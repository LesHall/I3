This program is a simple initial sketch in the Processing programming language (www.processing.org) of my concept of an Invention Inventor.  

The idea is an old classic:  create a dictionary of words and draw a few of them at random, then scroll a list of these word combinations looking for inspiration in some desired combination.  In this way the technique can spark inspiration.  

Of course with a large unfocused dictionary we get alphabet soup - the old monkeys and typewriters creating Shakespeare notion.  So it is necessary to focus and limit the dictionary well.  

One way planned to do this is to add artificial intelligence, possibly a neural net doing classification or inference, to limit the search space of phrases.  Another is to reduce the dictionary by using words from a given topic or field like electrical engineering or sewing or cars engines, etc.  Doubtless there exist a wide variety of ways to smarten up the output of this program and others like it.  

Have a look at the source code and maybe give it a try - you may like it!
